	<h1><strong>The Learn Enough to be Dangerous</strong></h1>
	<p>
		Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
		<em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
		command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
		everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
		Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
		We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
		learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
		movement, <a href="http://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our official email list now.</a>

	<h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
	<p>
		HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
		Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
		share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.
